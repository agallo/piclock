Python code to run clock on [Adafruit 16x2 LCD module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1110)

Requires:
* [Adafruit_CharLCD](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD/blob/master/Adafruit_CharLCD/Adafruit_CharLCD.py) (which itself has several dependancies)

Also, if not already done, you'll need to enable i2c on the Raspberry Pi
